# BitboardCheckers
This is a checkers project! It uses bitboards in order to simulate and manipulate the game of checkers through various binary operations.

### How It's Made
**Technology Used:** C and VSCode

Although there are other languages that can operate on the level of bits, I wanted to use C not only because of its direct accessibility to bit-wise operations, but also to gain experience with the programming language.

### Lessons Learned
This project has left me with notable knowledge on a list of different things:
- Using bitboards to represent player pieces and positions
- Working with binary operators in order to perform checkers like moves
- Programming with C, creating header files, implementing functions, using pointers, etc
