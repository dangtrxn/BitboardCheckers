# BitboardCheckers
This project simulates a game of checkers. It uses bitboards and binary operations in order to manipulate a game of checkers.

**Technology Used:** C and VSCode
Although there are other languages that can operate on the level of bits, I wanted to use C not only because of its ease with bit level operations, but also to gain experience with the programming language.
