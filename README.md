# BitboardCheckers
This project simulates a game of checkers. It uses bitboards and binary operations in order to manipulate a game of checkers.

### How It's Made
**Technology Used:** C and VSCode

Although there are other languages that can operate on the level of bits, I wanted to use C not only because of its ease with bit level operations, but also to gain experience with the programming language.

### Lessons Learned
This project has left me with notable knowledge on a list of different things:
- Using bitboards to represent checkers
- Working with binary operators in order to manipulate bitboards 
- Programming with C, creating header files, implementing functions, using pointers, etc
